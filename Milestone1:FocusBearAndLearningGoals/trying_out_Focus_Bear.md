# Trying out Focus Bear

**What was your first impression of the app?**  
I think some parts of the UI felt out of place and didn't interact with how I thought it would, some parts didn't fit to screen. While using the Mac client some windows were stuck behind others and I had to drag them out to be able to click options. I was unable to set a night routine at a time later than 12am because it was before the time of the morning routine. I also had an issue changing the language, it was held up for a while on a loading screen but during this I hit the habits menu and it had changed, and going back to the bearsona page it was still loading. 

**Did you find anything difficult to understand?**
Once completing the set morning routine tasks the list still shows, I didn't know if this was supposed to go away and show as completed since the only tasks that were left were locked due to free users only having the ability to have 3 checked but more displayed.

**If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?**  
It's a productivity app that will block distractions like social media on your phone and computer so when you go to open something like instagram it blocks it.

**What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?**  
For the Mac client I think some way of helping the installation and set up of the client would be good for a new user as some windows overlapped each other and could easily turn off someone from continueing. Some of the loading times are slightly longer than expected, including backgrounds takes slightly longer than the forground portion and could be unpleasing to some.
