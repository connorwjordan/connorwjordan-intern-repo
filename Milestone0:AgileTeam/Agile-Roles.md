# Agile Roles

**What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?**  
My role is as a product manager and this contributes by setting goals for the development of the product, this is through understanding the users needs, the prioritization of tasks, and measuring the outcome using key metrics.

**How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?**
Its important to keep tasks continually being completed to keep up with development needs and constantly introducing and updating features, this can overlap with project managers as they are also trying to make sure that timelines are kept and work is completed. There is a lot of communication between the product manager and the developers as they are the people actually making the product through the intruction that you give so it is important to be able to cleary communicate the tasks and goals that the developers should work towards.
