When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
AI can be used for research or coding but only as a means to produce what you are lacking, it should not be used to perform a task you are capable of but not willing to do but can be instead used to streamline a process.

How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
Not using AI as soon as you are tasked with something and trying to actually attempt to solve the problem before using AI as a resource for learning.

What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
Not uploading and using sensitive data to AI models, only using what is necessary for the task you are performing, trying to keep the same principle of least privelidge. When trying to code not uploading an entire code base but only the function you are trying to produce.
