# Terminal Knowledge

**Which terminal client did you choose? Why?**  
I chose to use iTerm2 as this terminal client gives more functionality compared to the default terminal including split display and more customization options. iTerm2 also includes other features that I have not used but might find useful in the future.

**What customizations (if any) did you make?**  
I changed some display settings so that it was more pleasent to look at. I also changed how theme to minimal so that the tab bar appears as part of the window bar, and to display the tab bar even when there is only one tab open.

**What was the most useful command you learned today?**
