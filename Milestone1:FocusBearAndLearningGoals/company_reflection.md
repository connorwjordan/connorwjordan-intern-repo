# Company Reflections

**Why do you think Focus Bear was created?**  
I think Focus Bear was created because there was a lack of a suitable app for the problems that Jeremy faced, this lead him to develop Focus Bear to fill this hole for himself and to also help others who have similar issues with staying focused and sticking to a scheduled routine. Focus Bear is also available for all devices so that no matter what you pick up you won't be given access to distracting apps and services while others are only available for either PC or mobile or lack functionality across both.

**What problem is Focus Bear solving?**  
Focus Bear is helping users stay on track with their set goals, if they want to follow a more structured routine the app will help them achieve this. It also helps people who are unable to or struggle with staying focused by preventing actions that are counter-productive to their study or work goals. Focus Bear is also designed for people with ADHD while other productivity apps are not and this leads to a better solution for these people as their issues are being addressed in the design.

**Why do you think this mission is important?**  
I think it is important because all people face different problems because someone who is neurodivergent may need additional help staying focused on working they may not be able to have productive working hours and this could also lead them to being more fatigued. 

**How does Focus Bearâ€™s work align with your personal values or interests?**  
I think it's important that everyone is given fair opportunity and has their issues and problems addressed so Focus Bear's initiative to help people with ADHD and other neurodivergent people aligns with that. 

**Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?**
I do have trouble sometimes self motivating myself to start work so having Focus Bear to set goals to set a morning and night routinte is a good way to develop healthy habbits that will help me stick to a working schedule. If I'm not very interested in the work I am doing for university it can be a struggle to stay focused if I have other distractions like social media so I often find myself on them when I'm trying to work if I'm bored of the content, so using the distraction blocking tools would let me stay focused on what is infront of me. I often also forget to take breaks to stretch and drink water so having set intervals that will remind me will help me improve my productivity and lessen burnout.
