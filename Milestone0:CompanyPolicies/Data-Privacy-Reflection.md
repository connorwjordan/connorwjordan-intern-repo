# Data Privacy Reflection

**What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?**  
Keep a private workstation so that unwanted eyes can't see my working screen, as well as locking my computer when I leave my work station so that no one is able to access it while I am not present. Do not have conversations in public that contains secure data so that people can't overhear anything that should be private. Only using encrypted messaging and not working while on public networks. Having my computer software up to date to prevent cyber incidents.

**How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?**  
Sensitive information should only be stored if needed and relevant, and should only be accessible by those who need to have access, following the principle of least access. Data should also have safe and secure backups incase of any incidents. If stored locally should only be done so on secure machines that have restricted access using passwords/PINs/Biometrics. Sensitive information should only be shared over secure methods such as encrypted messaging and emails, or internal networks. To dispose of sensitive information if stored on hard drives these should be over written before they are used for anything else or destroyed. If sensitive information is within a paper report or similar it can be shredded.

**What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?**  
Theft of credentials ddue to easy to guess or bruteforce passwords, previous data breaches where someone has used the same password over multiple services, this can be solved by using a password manager storing uniquely generated passwords for each different service. Phishing can lead to data breach incidents and can be solved via personnel training and testing to teach good cyber awareness to employees. Un-authorized physical access due to unlocked workstations or working in public without proper care of surroundings.
