# Git Knowledge

**Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?**  
I have used Git before in my capstone units at uni, I worked as part of a 50 person team developing a penetration testing GUI and I learnt how to use Git so that I could interact with the repo and complete tasks to develop work for this project. 

**Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?**  
I use Git in VScode in addition to using the terminal in VScode to use Git commands, I use the client in VScode because I find making commits using this tool very easy to see visualy, with what I have staged and writing commit messages, I use the command line when I'm creating branches and fetching updates.

**What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?**  
I starting using the Source Control Graph in VScode to see commit history and how I can use this for version control and troubleshooting.
