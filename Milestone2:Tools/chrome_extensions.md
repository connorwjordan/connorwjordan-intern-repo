# Chrome Extensions

**Which extensions did you install? Why?**  
React developer tools I already had installed from when I was learning to use React for my university capstone units, this is useful so that you can inspect React components in the chrome developer tools.
Redux DevTools is useful for debugging redux as it lets you track the application state changes to see when and why the state changed.
JSON Formatter was installed because it allows me to view JSON files with automatic formatting.
Lighthouse is for auditing web apps by performing tests against the page and then generating a report with the results.

**What was the most useful thing you learned?**
