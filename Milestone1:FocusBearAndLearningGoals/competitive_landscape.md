# Competitive Landscape

**What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?**  
While other apps focus on just one of blocking distractions, planning/scheduling, or habits/routines, Focus Bear combines all these into one service. Focus Bear is also able to use AI blocking features to block additional sites that are not currently on the blocked list of sites, this allows you to not get distracted using unrelated sites that you may not have known to previously blocked.

**If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?**  
I would choose Focus Bear because of the combination of features allows me to use only one application instead of downloading multiple to try and set habits on one, then use a different one for distraction blocking, also having a desktop and mobile client interacting with each other to block on both is useful as a lot of the time I will work using both.

**What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?**  
Cold Turkey allows you to set a schedule on when blocking is enbaled so that you can have pre determined working hours and have different levels of access depending on if you want to block specific applications as well like games.

**Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?**  
I think allowing you to set time blocks that should enforce harsh blocking that you can set that will contain the focus sessions within, so that each focus session isn't as individual but in a larger block of time.
