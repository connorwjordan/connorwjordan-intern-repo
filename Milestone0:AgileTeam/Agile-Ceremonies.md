# Agile Ceremonies

**How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?**  
Agile ceremonies like dailt stand-ups let you talk through what you are completing so that everyone is on the same page and knows who is doing what, this also gives a time to bring up any points that are causing you issues and if anyone has any solutions. Being able to communicate what you are working on is important to keep everyone involved in the development process. Planning for sprints and continous prioritization both show how important it is that everyone has the same understanding of the outcomes that are going to be worked on. Retrospection is also important in Agile about the past working period so that you can understand how the team went completing tasks, team communication, and how they are able to reflect and update/improve their processes and tools in the next spring/working period.

**Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?**  
I think continuous prioritization is the most important so that you are able to deliver work that is most critical to the ongoing development of the product, it is important to users that you deliver an product that they will use and this is through maintaining and producing new features or updates, and being able to prioritize these is an important part of the product managers role in understanding what the users needs are.
