# Learning Goals

**What do you hope to learn from this internship?**  
I want to learn what the day to day work of a product manager looks like, I am interested in the role but because there are less opportunities to see the role I think that will be the most interesting part of the internship. I want to learn about the process of being given a metric that you are trying to increase and how you can go through the development cycle from start to finish and learn about each step and how a product manager can make decisions through their understanding of the users needs to prioritize the tasks completed by developers.

**What skills are you most excited to develop?**  
I am excited to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills as these are extremely important to a product manager's role, while undertaking the tasks I have while on placement I hope that I will be able to learn from what this decision making process looks like from the start of an idea to the end delivered product.

**What do you think you can contribute to the team?**  


**What is one area you feel less confident in that youâ€™d like to improve?**  
Quick decision making in a professional setting, as most of my time at uni has been doing mostly individual assignments the decisions I make only have an impact on myself, however in a company when these decisions have a much larger net of people they effect I am not extremely confident in that ability. 

**What does success in this internship look like for you?**
Success for me is being able to perform the role of a product manager at a professional level and gaining the skills that is required for that. This includes technical and non-technical role as a very large part of the role is communication when interacting with users, developers, and anyone else involved with the product. I hope to also improve my technical skills as this is always a useful skill to have to better understand the development role and how to best communicate the ideas and decisions you make.
