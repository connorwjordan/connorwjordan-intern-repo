# OHS Laptop Ergonomics

**What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?** 
For my home workspace I have access to a desktop PC with a keyboard, mouse, external monitor, ergonomic chair, and adjustable stand/sit desk. I have set these up to be conducive towards a healthy work environment. My workspace while using my laptop has a laptop stand so that I am able to raise the screen height, as well as a portable keyboard and mouse.

**What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?**
Trying to maintain good posture by sitting upright, which can sometimes be hard since I am tall and most chair and desk setups that I use at university are unable to be adjusted to the height that I want, as well as sometimes there are objects under the desk that my legs sometimes hit. Taking regular breaks to relieve strain on my eyes by doing the 20 20 20 method of every 20 minutes looking at an object 20 meters away for 20 seconds, however I also often stare off into the distance when I need to think about something for a while as not staring directly at the work can sometimes help myself clarify my thoughts. While taking breaks also to stretch my arms, shoulders, legs, and anything else that is under strain by getting up and walking around for a few seconds.

**How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?** 
I have started using the focus mode on the focus bear app to remind me when I have been working for a while so that I can take these breaks overtime instead of working for a few hours and being sore and drained afterwards. I also have these breaks to remind me to drink more water if I have not been doing so for the duration of the focus time.
