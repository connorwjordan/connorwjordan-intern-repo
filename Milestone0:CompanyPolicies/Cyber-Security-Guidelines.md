# Cyber Security Guidelines

**What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?**  
 I use a password manager to save my passwords for currently used accounts so that I can use strong randomly generated passwords, I however have some older accounts that are not in use for non-critical services that could potentially be at risk from data breaches, and even though the passwords are redundant should still be cleaned up. I lock my colaptop when not in use and use passcodes and biometrics for security. 

**How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?**  
 I can form a new secure behaviour into a habit by trying to constantly remind myself of it, and using reminders so that once I have performed the action over time it will become the habit.

**What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?**  
 I will keep all my passwords secure in a password manager, these passwords are also randomly generated using upper and lowercase, numbers, and if the service allows, special characters. I will also enable 2FA is available so that I can see any notice of attempted login and change passwords if needed.

**What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?**  
 I would change the password of the effected account and contact my supervisor immediatly. I would also try and detail anything that could have lead to the incident. This is important so that action can be taken at a higher level if needed and because it is important to have every incident on record so that any judgements on the cyber policies can be made with full awareness and context.
