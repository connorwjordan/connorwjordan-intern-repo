# Professionalism Reflection

**Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?**  


**What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?**  
Using professional language and etiquette when communicating with other members of the Focus Bear team, this includes verbal and written through emails, discord messages, feedback, and any other forms of communication. Being mindful of the tone you use while communicating and how it can be hard to convey tone in written communications. It's important to understand everyone has different communication habits and ways of prefered communication so that both you and who you are communicating with are comfortable.

**How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?**  
I can do this by being open and friendly while working with others, taking time to get to know the people you work with and their likes/dislikes so that you can know where you have commonalities. Being respectful of eachother's time and energy, not wasting anyones time with things when they are busy or interupting someone with unrelated or something non urgent when they are trying to work. I enjoy being social and talking when getting lunch or taking small breaks so taking shared breaks can be a good way to take mind of work a bit and re-energize.
