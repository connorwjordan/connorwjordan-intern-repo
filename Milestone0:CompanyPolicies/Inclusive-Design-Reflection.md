# Inclusive Design Reflections

**How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?**  
Be clear with my communication so that I don't cause any confusion, this can be done by given step by step instruction, not using slang or jargon that they may not understand, and not overwhelming someone with info. I want people to be comfortable when talking to me so that they are able to be likely to reach out if they need and not want to ignore any problems or avoid conversing with me. 

**What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?**  
Hard to read fonts and font sizes, this can also be distracting fonts that they are unable to focus on, bright and contrasting colours that can be offputting or straining, hard to use or understand layouts, having features that are not intuitive so that users might be onsure of the functions purpose or use.

**What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?**  
I can be flexible in how I communicate and work with others. Everyone has different preferences to how they want to be interacted with or messaged, and also how they want to work, so itâ€™s important to know your team members so that you can be respectful of these preferences. Trying to get everyone to be comfortable while working so they can produce their best work is important for the company and against individual fatigue.
