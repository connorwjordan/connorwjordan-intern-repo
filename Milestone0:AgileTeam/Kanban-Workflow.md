# Kanban Workflow

**How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?**  
It lets you set tasks importance when they are created so that you can take on tasks that are more critical to work on rather than minor tasks that have no need to be completed asap. Kanban boards also show how many tasks are currently in progress and limiting this encourages completing work that is already in progress over to completion rather than starting a new task and not having anything delivered. Not taking on too many tasks at once also lets you focus on what you are doing rather than thinking about multiple things at once and being overwhelmed. 

**How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?**  
I can write daily/weekly to do lists that I am able to check off, this should be done through importance as well as if I'm already started on something that I can finish quickly do that before starting something else that will take a while as I will be able to focus on one thing rather than being overwhelmed by the amount of tasks I am performing.
